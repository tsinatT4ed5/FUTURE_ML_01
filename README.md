# Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecasting

## General Description
This project focuses on analyzing **Superstore Sales Data** to uncover meaningful business insights and predict future sales performance.

### Main Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data for accurate analysis  
- Visualize key trends using **Python** and **Power BI** for storytelling  
- Build predictive models using **Facebook Prophet** and **XGBoost** to forecast future sales and identify performance patterns  

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data-driven business decision-making** — from data preparation to model building and visualization.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection & Understanding
- Used the *Superstore Sales Dataset* (from Kaggle / public sources)  
- Explored dataset structure and checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing data and corrected inconsistent entries  
- Converted date columns to proper datetime formats  
- Created new features (e.g., month, year, profit margin, sales category)  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified top-performing products, regions, and customer segments  
- Analyzed profit trends and discount effects  
- Visualized insights using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Power BI**  

### 4. Model Building & Forecasting
- **Prophet Model:** Used for time-series forecasting to predict future sales trends  
- **XGBoost Model:** Built for regression/classification tasks to identify sales drivers and improve prediction accuracy  

### 5. Interactive Power BI Dashboard
- Created dynamic visuals showing **historical trends**, **forecasted sales**, and **key performance indicators (KPIs)**  
- Added slicers and filters for interactive storytelling  

### 6. Insights & Business Impact
- Found sales peaks and seasonal trends that can guide inventory and marketing planning  
- Identified top customers and high-performing regions for targeted campaigns  
- Forecasting supports **revenue prediction** and **resource optimization** for upcoming quarters
