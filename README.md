Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecasting
  General Description

This project focuses on analyzing Superstore Sales Data to uncover meaningful business insights and predict future sales performance.
The main objectives were:

To clean and preprocess raw sales data for accurate analysis.

To visualize key trends using Python and Power BI for storytelling.

To build predictive models using Facebook Prophet and XGBoost to forecast future sales and identify performance patterns.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data-driven business decision-making — from data preparation to model building and visualization.

   Project Steps

Data Collection & Understanding

Used the Superstore Sales Dataset (from Kaggle / public dataset sources).

Explored dataset structure and checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing data and corrected inconsistent entries.

Converted date columns to proper datetime formats.

Created new features (e.g., month, year, profit margin, sales category).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified top-performing products, regions, and customer segments.

Analyzed profit trends and discount effects.

Visualized insights using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI.

Model Building & Forecasting

Prophet Model: Used for time-series forecasting to predict future sales trends.

XGBoost Model: Built for regression/classification tasks to identify sales drivers and make more accurate predictions.

Interactive Power BI Dashboard

Created dynamic visuals showing historical trends, forecasted sales, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Added slicers and filters for storytelling .

Insights & Business Impact

Found sales peaks and seasonal trends that can guide inventory and marketing planning.

Identified top customers and high-performing regions for targeted campaigns.

Forecasting helps in revenue prediction and resource optimization for upcoming quarters.

 Key Insights

Sales Trends: Sales increased significantly during the holiday seasons (November–December).

Regional Insights: The West region performed best, while the Central region needs improvement strategies.

Category Analysis: Office Supplies had consistent sales, while Furniture had high-value but lower-frequency sales.

Forecasting: Prophet model projected a steady upward trend for the next quarter.

These findings can help businesses optimize inventory, improve marketing timing, and forecast revenue effectively.
